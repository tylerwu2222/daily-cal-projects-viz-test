Construction will be performed as a component of the Central Berkeley Transportation & Infrastructure Improvements Project, which began in May 2021 and is scheduled to be substantially complete in early 2022. As a busy commercial corridor served by multiple bus lanes, University Avenue is intimidating for most people who ride their bike. The Addison Bike Boulevard will specifically provide an east-west connection between Milvia Street and Sacramento Street to connect West Berkeley to Downtown Berkeley. The project includes new bike boulevard pavement markings and signage for a Class 3 bikeway, in which motor vehicles will share the street with bicyclists, new crosswalk markings and pedestrian-scale lighting at selected intersections, and rectangular rapid flashing beacons (RRFBs) across Martin Luther King Jr. Way at the Addison Street intersection. Bicycle Boulevards are an important facility in a City’s street design toolkit, designed to bring low stress connectivity through residential neighborhoods. The focus of this project is to create a shared street environment that is comfortable for school children and less confident cyclists. A combination of signage, striping, and lighting treatments can increase awareness of people walking and bicycling. In addition to the striping and signing elements supporting a bicycle boulevard along Addison Street, rectangular rapid flashing beacons are planned to be installed at Addison and Martin Luther King, Jr. Way.',\n",

Working with the Water Emergency Transportation Authority (WETA) and the consultant team, the City has concluded this 2-year project, including a rigorous 1-year public process, and has chosen a preferred conceptual plan to reconstruct the currently closed Berkeley Pier and include ferry access. This concept plan includes: (1) evaluation of the structural integrity of the existing pier, (2) development of conceptual alternatives, (3) identification of environmental and regulatory permits and (4) cost estimates. The landside and waterside preferred concepts are described (with visuals) in the December 7, 2021 City Council Session linked below. The next step for this project is to identify $10M -$11M in funding for the Design Development phase, including the environmental review process. Once funding is identified, the City and WETA will execute a second agreement for environmental studies and design development. It is anticipated that this process will take 2-3 years. The Pier-Ferry Planning Study public process involved a community process in the form of four (4) Focus groups in early January, 2021 and three large Community Workshops on January 21, 2021, August 10, 2021, and October 27, 2021. The project was presented at the City Council Worksession on February 16, 2021, followed by a WETA Board of Directors meeting on March 4, 2021. The presentation slides and breakout group notes for these meetings can be found on this webpage below. An online questionnaire for the project was conducted to seek broader community feedback. Below is the questionnaire results report. The goal of these meetings was to receive extensive community feedback to develop a preferred concept for the project. The preferred concept was presented to City Council in December of 2021 and the WETA Board in April of 2022. The Berkeley Municipal Pier was closed in July, 2015 due to visually observed structural problems on the underside of the concrete decking and pilings. In 2017, the City retained a structural engineering firm (GHD) to assess the problem and develop a range of potential solutions and costs. In 2018, the Water Emergency Transportation Authority (WETA) staff-initiated discussions with City staff regarding the possibility of new ferry service at the Berkeley Waterfront. During those initial discussions, WETA and City staff realized that it could be cost-effective to investigate a single pier that would provide two uses – ferry service and public recreation. In 2019, WETA and the City Council authorized a Memorandum of Understanding Agreement (MOU) to jointly fund a planning study to evaluate the feasibility of a dual-purpose pier. For background details, see the Council Report approval of the MOU on March 12, 2019.',\n",

The conceptual design should serve for mountain bikers, BMX bikers, adaptive cyclists, youth, and young adults, and is envisioned to include progressive features, challenge elements, and alternate lines that encourage users to grow their skills safely. A community process has begun in order to engage the bike community to inform a conceptual design for the project. The initial round of public outreach took place in Spring 2022. It involved a focus group, community questionnaire, and workshop, along with public comments shared via email and phone. The initial round of feedback has been synthesized and was translated into two conceptual design alternatives shared with the community on September 29, 2022.The project team received specific feedback on each concept at the workshop.

There has been a history of collisions and near-collisions at this intersection. The project originated as a Council Referral in October 2017 to improve the safety of the intersection, particularly for pedestrians and bicyclists. The project was budgeted in late 2018, and City staff prepared a conceptual design in 2019. Design concepts were developed by City traffic engineering staff in 2019 but stopped shy of detailed design due to staffing shortages. In response to recent increasing public interest to advance this project in an expedited manner, City staff restarted the design in April 2021 by utilizing a limited window of staff availability and by reprioritizing project commitments. Safety issues and proposed work at the Dwight/California intersection were discussed at events with the public and nearby residents and in Transportation Commission meetings in 2018 and 2019. The City hosted an online community meeting May 12, 2021. Two design alternatives were presented, and City staff proceeded with the design of Alternative 1, which includes a median refuge island on Dwight Way.Construction of project elements will be phased as follows: (1) pedestrian improvements, consisting of sidewalk extensions, directional curb ramps, a relocated western crosswalk, and intersection striping; (2) a temporary, “quick build” median refuge island on Dwight Way and evaluation of traffic data to determine if additional traffic controls are warranted; and (3) construction of a more permanent median refuge island, which is dependent on the results of the traffic evaluation, and repaving the intersection roadway, applying a pavement coating on a portion of California Street north of the intersection, reconfiguring the southbound bike lane to improve safety, and installing new pavement markings. Phase 1: The City completed Phase 1, which included pedestrian improvements, in December 2021. Phase 2: The City completed Phase 2, which included a temporary median refuge island and associated pavement marking and signage improvements, in March 2022. Staff have evaluated resulting traffic data and will present the findings in the community meeting on June 1, 2022. Phase 3: City staff are working to address community comments on the temporary median, including size and shape. Once these comments are addressed, the City will construct a more permanent median refuge island, repave the intersection roadway, apply a pavement coating on a portion of California Street north of the intersection, reconfigure the southbound bike lane to improve safety, and install new pavement markings.  Dwight Way is a two-way, two-lane arterial street with high traffic volumes, including AC Transit buses. California Street is a two-way, two-lane collector street and is part of City’s low-stress bikeway network; in particular, it is used by pedestrians and cyclists traveling to/from Longfellow Middle School.',\n",

       "  \"Objectives of the project are to: The project plans include a Class IV protected bikeway with separation from motor traffic by way of a vertical element, intersection treatments and traffic calming features, and elimination of the slip lane at Milvia and Center Street. Initial funding for conceptual design and environmental review has been provided by a grant from the Alameda County Transportation Commission (Alameda CTC). Funding for detailed engineering design and construction has been provided by a grant from the State of California Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities (AHSC) program. Berkeley has the highest rate of bicycling to work in the United States among cities with over 100,000 residents, and Milvia is the City’s primary north-south bikeway. In recent years, there's been a significant rise in bicycle activity in Downtown Berkeley, particularly along Milvia Street. At last count, over 500 people on bicycles pass through the intersection of Milvia and Channing during the 2-hour PM peak period alone. During the same period, over 400 pass through the Intersection of Milvia and Hearst. While the high volume of use is encouraging, there has also been a high volume of collisions. According to analysis completed for the City Bicycle Plan 2017, Milvia Street had the highest number of total collisions between 2001 and 2012, which suggests that design changes should be evaluated to better accommodate the mix of roadway users along this downtown Bicycle Boulevard. The National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) recommends vehicle volumes lower than 1,500 per day to provide a comfortable bicycling environment for children, families, and others who feel unsafe riding in traffic. A number of City plans and policies have highlighted the stretch of Milvia Street in Downtown Berkeley as a high priority area for bicycle facility improvements. The Strategic Plan (2018), Bicycle Plan (2017), and Strategic Transportation Plan (2016) recommend replacing the existing segments of Class III bicycle shared-roadway markings and Class II bicycle lanes on Milvia between Hearst Avenue and Blake Street with a Class IV protected bikeway (also known as a cycle track). Similarly, the Streets and Open Space Improvement Plan (2012) and Downtown Area Plan (2012) recommend establishing a continuous bicycle lane and traffic calming on Milvia through downtown.\",\n",

Construction began in March 2020 and is anticipated to be complete in Fall 2021. Phase I, completed in 2012, created a 0.1-mile, two-block section of Class 1 pathway from Murray Street to the Emeryville Greenway. Bicycle and pedestrian access from the Phase I pathway to the Ninth Street Bicycle Boulevard, is currently provided by a temporary Class 3 bicycle route on another section of Ninth Street that is separate from the main Ninth Street Bicycle Boulevard. A Class 3 bike route is a street designated for bicycle travel and shared with motor vehicles. This temporary route was constructed along Ninth Street between Anthony Street and Murray Street and on private property belonging to Berkeley Bowl West through a temporary easement, which was part of the provisions in their development agreement with the City. This Class 3 facility does not provide adequate bicycle and pedestrian access because it requires a longer, non-linear route and requires bicyclists to share a relatively narrow and congested road with motor vehicles. Phase II completes the pathway connection between West Berkeley and Emeryville by providing a safer, more direct, and continuous off-street route and intersection crossing, as opposed to the current temporary route. Phase II will construct the last two sections of new shared-use pathway on City-owned property; one section from the end of Ninth Street just south of the intersection with Heinz Avenue to Ashby Avenue, and the other section between Ashby Avenue and Murray Street. Phase II will also construct signal and intersection improvements near the intersection of Ninth Street and Ashby Avenue, where the pathway will cross Ashby Avenue.',\n",

The primary goals of the project involve expanding the City’s interconnected network of bikeways, and connecting neighborhoods in the disadvantaged West Berkeley area to the North Berkeley BART rail station by way of a shared bikeway connection to the existing West Street Pathway. The new improvements will also connect West Berkeley with San Pablo Park and other green spaces. The general scope of the project involves installation of bike boulevard infrastructure consisting of striping, pavement markings, and wayfinding signage along the length of the corridor. The Parker Addison Mobility and Safety Improvements project also includes new traffic circle construction, Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacons (RRFBs), traffic calming, sidewalk, curb ramp construction, and striping. The project will also widen the existing ramp walkway located at the north end of the Strawberry Creek Park basketball courts, as well as two adjacent curb ramps located at both ends of the West Street cul-de-sac. Speed tables will be installed on Bonar Street, from Addison Street to Allston Way, as a result of a community-initiated traffic calming study performed by the Traffic Engineering Department. The Parker-Addison Mobility and Safety Improvements project will provide one continuous bikeway network connecting West Berkeley to San Pablo Park, the North Berkeley BART station, and other key areas throughout Berkeley. Furthermore, the new bike boulevard on Parker Street will connect residents to the industrial and commercial areas of West Berkeley as well as to the existing Channing Way Bike Boulevard, Downtown Berkeley, the UC Berkeley campus, and other existing and proposed north-south Bicycle Boulevards, including several schools, parks and residential areas. Questions or comments? Please contact the project manager, Ian Bronswick, Associate Civil Engineer, ibronswick@cityofberkeley.info.

Construction of the Project began in July 2020 and is anticipated to be completed in December 2021.',\n",
       "  'This Project addresses two City Council referrals for intersection safety improvements that are high-priority projects in the Pedestrian Master Plan – Sacramento Street at Addison Street (High Priority Project #4) and Sacramento Street at Virginia Street (High Priority Project #24). The improvements at Virginia Street and Delaware Street also address Tier 1 priority projects from the Bicycle Plan. In general, the work of this Project includes construction of new sidewalk extensions with directional curb ramps that meet the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); new pavement markings, including crosswalk, vehicular lane, and bike lane markings; a new traffic signal at the Virginia Street intersection; and dedicated left turn traffic signal phases at the University Avenue intersection to eliminate conflicts between pedestrians and left turning vehicles. For bicyclists that are comfortable sharing the roadway with a low volume of motor vehicles, the proposed new traffic signal at the Virginia Street intersection will improve safety for bicyclists along the Virginia Street bicycle boulevard and will encourage more bicycle riders to use this route. There will also be safety-related improvements for bicyclists that prefer to ride on a separated pathway, away from motor vehicles. City staff have been working closely with Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) on the latter’s proposed bicycle and motor vehicle ingress and egress modifications at the North Berkeley BART station. BART’s project will provide a needed link between two segments of the Ohlone Greenway pathway that are separated by this BART station, via dedicated bike lanes that will route bicyclists through the BART station grounds. BART’s construction project is expected to begin several months after the start of construction on the Sacramento Complete Streets Improvements Project. City staff hosted community meetings on January 28 and April 16, 2019 to solicit public input on the Project. The Project design was subsequently refined, and on May 15, 2019, staff presented the Project to a subcommittee of the Transportation Commission for comment. The Project design was refined based on comments received, and on June 20, 2019, staff presented the Project to the Transportation Commission. The Commission was supportive of the Project, and provided additional comments, which staff used to finalize the design documents.',\n",

To be included in the list to receive project updates, please contact the project team with subject “Please add me to Santa Fe Trackbed to Park Conversion email list” and provide your preferred contact information. The Santa Fe Trackbed to Park Conversion project is funded by Proposition 68 California Statewide Park Development and Community Revitalization Program (SPP) grant. Part of the State’s “Outdoors for All” initiative to enable all Californians to access parks and open space, the competitive CA SPP grant expands access to parks in underserved communities with new or enhanced parks. The City will remediate any soil contamination left by the site’s historic railroad use and ensure the site is safe for its future use as a new park. Initial soil sampling results show elevated levels of arsenic and lead in these four parcels. The City has posted signs on all four blocks. Initial soil sampling results can be found at this linkor go to the \"Documents\" section of this page. January 2023 Update The City’s case has been assigned to the CA Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC). To follow the environmental work for this project, please visit DTSC’s Berkeley Santa Fe Trackbed to Park project webpage. Rail service began along the Santa Fe Railroad Right-of-Way in 1884 and ran until 1980 when the City acquired the rail line property through Berkeley. In the 1980s, City of Berkeley converted several portions of the former Santa Fe parcels into public amenities, including the following: Cedar-Rose Park,Strawberry Creek Park, the Ohlone Greenway, the West Street Pathway, three housing authority projects. , and several community gardening sites (Northside, Peralta, Karl Linn, Bancroft, and Spiral Gardens). In 2021, the City received a $5 million grant from the California Proposition 68 Statewide Parks Program (SPP) to convert some of the last undeveloped Santa Fe parcels in South Berkeley into a new urban park. The grant application involved an extensive community process that led to a final conceptual plan for the new park that reflected community priorities. The conceptual plan submitted with the grant application and approved for funding is attached in the “Documents” section at the bottom of this webpage.

Improvements such as new bus shelters, improved boarding areas, and street repair will make it safer, easier, and more comfortable to take public transit, and supports policies laid out in the City's General Plan Transportation Element. The project will upgrade four existing bus stops at the following locations: The project scope includes new bus shelters, pedestrian bulb-outs, bus bulbs, bus pads, curb ramps, localized pavement repair, striping, and traffic signal improvements. The new bus shelters will also include solar-powered lighting, seating, and a transit map for the waiting area. This project supports the policies and actions of the City of Berkeley General Plan Transportation Element by making transit more convenient, dependable, and attractive, and by reducing the number of automobile trips in Berkeley as a result of increased transit use and alternative modes of transportation. The Transportation Element identifies the network of streets that necessitate efficient and effective transit services throughout the city. These streets are the highest priority for transit improvements, such as bus bulbs and bus shelters. In cases where a major street is identified as a Primary Transit Route, improvements are designed to prioritize the movement of public transportation vehicles through the corridor, increase transit use, and promote alternative modes of travel which help reduce the number of automobile trips along the corridor. The University West Bus Stops Project supports the following General Plan Transportation Element policies: The project is funded by a $550,000 Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities (AHSC) grant allocation with supplemental funding made available through Alameda County Measure B and Measure BB Local Streets and Roads programs. The AHSC Program is a competitive state funding program that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by funding compact affordable housing in conjunction with sustainable transportation improvements.

Willard Clubhouse replacement project appeared before the Berkeley Zoning Adjustments Board on April 27, 2023 for a Use Permit and consideration of a variance to reduce the rear setback of the main building from 20’ to 16’ to preserve more of the existing lawn on the north side of the building, and for approval for a new accessory structure (a new public restroom). Pending project review and approval by the Berkeley Zoning Adjustments Board, the project will complete design and submit for building permit review and approval. The status of the Zoning Project Application and Building Permits can be found atParcel Conditions and Permit History. Construction is anticipated to commence in Fiscal Year 2024. The community engagement process included facilitated discussions with residents, stakeholders, user groups, and families participating in programs offered at Willard Clubhouse, and City of Berkeley staff. From October of 2019 to October of 2021, a series of 5 in-person and virtual community meetings with staff were held to gather input and hear about the needs and concerns of the community. Community and stakeholder meetings, workshops, and surveys took place between September 2019 and October 2021. Please see Past Events and Documents below for more information on the previously held community meetings. Built in 1971, the Willard Clubhouse is located at the southeast corner of Willard Park at 2720 Hillegass Avenue, between Derby Street and Stuart Street. The small 565 SF one-story, one-room clubhouse has long been a staple of Berkeley’s after-school and summer day camp programs, with each program serving a maximum of 45 elementary school aged children. Enrollment for both the after-school and summer day camp programs quickly reach the maximum capacity every year with a typical waitlist of approximately 25 children. Occupancy of the existing clubhouse is limited, therefore in order to accommodate 45 children, staff makes use of the adjacent covered patio, as well as the outside open lawn area to run activities and programs. Additionally, the large open lawn area makes the clubhouse and park a suitable location for the City’s recreation staff to host events such as the Annual Spring Egg Hunt Extravaganza. Willard Park is a valuable resource for the neighborhood, and the community has expressed that Willard Clubhouse is long overdue for an update to meet the evolving needs of the entire community. In the spring of 2019, the City of Berkeley selected ELS Architecture and Urban Design, a local firm, to provide professional architectural design services for the Willard Clubhouse and Restroom Replacement Project. Together with the City, the project team set out to design a new Willard Clubhouse that would meet the City’s program needs and also be sustainable, modern, accessible, and multi-generational. In October 2021, the final conceptual design for the new Willard Clubhouse and Restrooms was presented to the community. The design was for a 4,195 SF all electric, multi-purpose recreation building and featured a lobby, all gender restrooms, an office, kitchen, a 790 SF community room, and a larger 1,570 SF community room with a divisible wall to split the space into two smaller rooms. The site plan on page 15 of the October 28th, 2021 community meeting presentation shows the new building with a 20’ minimum required rear setback. Over the course of the community engagement period, members of the community expressed concern with expanding the clubhouse and its impact to open space. In response to the feedback from the community regarding preservation of lawn space, the project team has requested a variance to reduce the minimum 20’ rear setback to 16’ which would reduce the impacted lawn space. From October 2021 to May 2022, the project team developed a schematic design package for the new Willard Clubhouse and Restrooms, and prepared a Zoning Project Application that included the request for a 16’ rear setback variance. The application package was submitted to the City of Berkeley Land Use and Planning Division in June 2022. Due to a sharp increase in construction costs, 15% in 2021 and another anticipated 10% in 2022, the cost estimate for the preferred plan for the new Willard Clubhouse has escalated the total project budget to over $8.0M. $7.0M of funding was identified in Phase 2 of T1, the City’s $100M Bond Measure passed in 2016. In response to the unanticipated increase, the project was reduced in size and scope. Therevised designreduces the building area to 3,285 SF. In lieu of three community rooms, comprising approximately 2,360 SF of activity space, the new community building will include one, divisible community room comprising approximately 1,700 SF and a new separate public restroom on the west side of the park. All other features will remain. The revised design provides an opportunity to create a multi-purpose outdoor plaza to the east of the building, similar in size to the existing outdoor plaza. ',\n",

       "  'The existing makeshift traffic circle at the Woolsey Street/Eton Avenue intersection is not functioning efficiently as a traffic calming device. The objective of a traffic calming device is to encourage motorists to reduce their speed as they maneuver around the circle. The circle is also not configured to optimize vehicle turning movements. The Project is intended to improve safety for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists by reducing vehicular speeds, improving vehicle turning movements, and creating accessible pedestrian pathways by constructing new curb ramps and marked crosswalks. The Project originated as a result of a request by members of the neighborhood several years ago to enhance and improve the existing makeshift traffic circle. Initial funding was secured to perform an engineering study in 2014 under the City’s annual Traffic Calming budget. Prior scheduled projects to perform underground utility and paving work, as well as reprioritization of other competing projects resulted in a pause in work on this project. In 2019, City staff performed the engineering study, but due to a Public Works staffing shortage and the public health pandemic in 2020, funding for this project was reprioritized for other uses and the Project was again paused. The 2019 engineering study generated two conceptual design options based on traffic engineering design analysis and principles. Staff presented these options in an online community meeting on October 7, 2021. Based on community input, City staff will finalize the design and prepare “shovel-ready” construction bid documents. Woolsey Street and Eton Avenue are two-way, asphalt-paved residential streets with relatively low traffic volumes. According to the City’s General Plan, the nearest Major Street is College Avenue, located about 400 feet west of the intersection (intersecting Woolsey), and the nearest Collector Street is Claremont Avenue, located about 700 feet to the southeast (intersecting Eton). A makeshift traffic circle exists at the intersection of Woolsey and Eton. It consists of three spaced concrete planters (shown in green below) enclosed by a white circular pavement marking. The planters contain community-maintained vegetation. The three roadway legs of the intersection – two on Woolsey and one on Eton – each have yield markings. There are no marked crosswalks at the intersection, although two curb ramps exist, one on each side of Eton. Estimated Schedule:',\n",
