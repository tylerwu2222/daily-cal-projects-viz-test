Addison Street Bicycle Boulevard Project,Design,Transportation,The Addison Bike Boulevard will specifically provide an east-west connection between Milvia Street and Sacramento Street to connect West Berkeley to Downtown Berkeley.,"The Addison Bike Boulevard project is intended to address the community need, identified in the City of Berkeley Bicycle Plan (2017), for a bike route paralleling University Avenue. City Council approved the final project plans and specifications on January 26, 2021, and the construction contract was awarded to Sposeto Engineering, Inc. Construction will be performed as a component of the Central Berkeley Transportation & Infrastructure Improvements Project, which began in May 2021 and is scheduled to be substantially complete in early 2022. As a busy commercial corridor served by multiple bus lanes, University Avenue is intimidating for most people who ride their bike. The Addison Bike Boulevard will specifically provide an east-west connection between Milvia Street and Sacramento Street to connect West Berkeley to Downtown Berkeley. The project includes new bike boulevard pavement markings and signage for a Class 3 bikeway, in which motor vehicles will share the street with bicyclists, new crosswalk markings and pedestrian-scale lighting at selected intersections, and rectangular rapid flashing beacons (RRFBs) across Martin Luther King Jr. Way at the Addison Street intersection. Bicycle Boulevards are an important facility in a City’s street design toolkit, designed to bring low stress connectivity through residential neighborhoods. The focus of this project is to create a shared street environment that is comfortable for school children and less confident cyclists. A combination of signage, striping, and lighting treatments can increase awareness of people walking and bicycling. In addition to the striping and signing elements supporting a bicycle boulevard along Addison Street, rectangular rapid flashing beacons are planned to be installed at Addison and Martin Luther King, Jr. Way.",[],['Kenneth Jung'],"[['Kenneth Jung', 'Project Manager', 'kjung@cityofberkeley.info']]",[]

Berkeley Municipal Pier-Ferry Project,Completed,Other Infrastructure,Berkeley Municipal Pier,"This is aMeasure T1Phase 1 project. The City is working with a consultant to conduct a Structural Condition Assessment / Restoration Feasibility Study for the currently-closed Berkeley Municipal Pier. This Restoration Feasibility Study will initially: (1) evaluate the existing structural integrity of the Pier, (2) develop conceptual restoration alternatives to facilitate reopening the Pier for public use in the most cost effective manner, (3) provide recommendations on rehabilitation priorities, (4) identify environmental and regulatory permitting requirements (5) determine cost estimates, and (6) depending on the results of the structural condition evaluation, the Study will explore the feasibility of ferry services at the Pier, and any ferry-related additional appurtenances that might be needed. The assessment is complete and will be a guiding document to ultimately identity the feasibility and magnitude of improvements to the Berkeley’s Berkeley Municipal Pier. The Pier-Ferry Planning Study public process involved a community process in the form of four (4) Focus groups in early January, 2021 and three large Community Workshops on January 21, 2021, August 10, 2021, and October 27, 2021. The project was presented at the City Council Worksession on February 16, 2021, followed by a WETA Board of Directors meeting on March 4, 2021. The presentation slides and breakout group notes for these meetings can be found on this webpage below. An online questionnaire for the project was conducted to seek broader community feedback. Below is the questionnaire results report. The goal of these meetings was to receive extensive community feedback on the project and incorporate feedback into the preliminary concepts for the project. The goal is to develop a final recommendation for the community, City Council and the WETA Board by the end of the 2021 calendar year. If the concept and design funding are approved by the City and WETA,the City and WETA would execute a second MOU for design and environmental studies. The Design Phase is anticipated take 2 to 3 years. The Berkeley Municipal Pier was closed in July, 2015 due to visually observed structural problems on the underside of the concrete decking and pilings. In 2017, the City retained a structural engineering firm (GHD) to assess the problem and develop a range of potential solutions and costs. In 2018, the Water Emergency Transportation Authority (WETA) staff-initiated discussions with City staff regarding the possibility of new ferry service at the Berkeley Waterfront. During those initial discussions, WETA and City staff realized that it could be cost-effective to investigate a single pier that would provide two uses – ferry service and public recreation. In 2019, WETA and the City Council authorized a Memorandum of Understanding Agreement (MOU) to jointly fund a planning study to evaluate the feasibility of a dual-purpose pier. If the answer is yes, the two agencies would execute amendments to the MOU to fund the next phases of the project (design, construction, and operations/maintenance).

The project originated as a Council Referral in October 2017 to improve the safety of the intersection, particularly for pedestrians and bicyclists. The project was budgeted in late 2018, and City staff prepared a conceptual design in 2019. Design concepts were developed by City traffic engineering staff in 2019 but stopped shy of detailed design due to staffing shortages. In response to recent increasing public interest to advance this project in an expedited manner, City staff restarted the design in April 2021 by utilizing a limited window of staff availability and by reprioritizing project commitments. Safety issues and proposed work at the Dwight/California intersection were discussed at events with the public and nearby residents and in Transportation Commission meetings in 2018 and 2019. The City hosted an online community meeting May 12, 2021. Two design alternatives were presented, and City staff proceeded with the design of Alternative 1, which includes a median refuge island on Dwight Way.Construction of project elements will be phased as follows: (1) pedestrian improvements, consisting of sidewalk extensions, directional curb ramps, a relocated western crosswalk, and intersection striping; (2) a temporary, “quick build” median refuge island on Dwight Way and evaluation of traffic data to determine if additional traffic controls are warranted; and (3) construction of a more permanent median refuge island, which is dependent on the results of the traffic evaluation, and repaving the intersection roadway, applying a pavement coating on a portion of California Street north of the intersection, reconfiguring the southbound bike lane to improve safety, and installing new pavement markings. Phase 1: The City completed Phase 1, which included pedestrian improvements, in December 2021. Phase 2: The City completed Phase 2, which included a temporary median refuge island and associated pavement marking and signage improvements, in March 2022. Staff have evaluated resulting traffic data and will present the findings in the community meeting on June 1, 2022. Phase 3: City staff are working to address community comments on the temporary median, including size and shape. Once these comments are addressed, the City will construct a more permanent median refuge island, repave the intersection roadway, apply a pavement coating on a portion of California Street north of the intersection, reconfigure the southbound bike lane to improve safety, and install new pavement markings.  Dwight Way is a two-way, two-lane arterial street with high traffic volumes, including AC Transit buses.

Milvia Street Bikeway Improvements Project,Completed,Transportation,"The project covers 12 contiguous blocks of Milvia Street, from Hearst Avenue to the north to Blake Street to the south.","Objectives of the project are to: The project plans include a Class IV protected bikeway with separation from motor traffic by way of a vertical element, intersection treatments and traffic calming features, and elimination of the slip lane at Milvia and Center Street. Initial funding for conceptual design and environmental review has been provided by a grant from the Alameda County Transportation Commission (Alameda CTC). Funding for detailed engineering design and construction has been provided by a grant from the State of California Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities (AHSC) program. Berkeley has the highest rate of bicycling to work in the United States among cities with over 100,000 residents, and Milvia is the City’s primary north-south bikeway. In recent years, there's been a significant rise in bicycle activity in Downtown Berkeley, particularly along Milvia Street. At last count, over 500 people on bicycles pass through the intersection of Milvia and Channing during the 2-hour PM peak period alone. During the same period, over 400 pass through the Intersection of Milvia and Hearst. While the high volume of use is encouraging, there has also been a high volume of collisions. According to analysis completed for the City Bicycle Plan 2017, Milvia Street had the highest number of total collisions between 2001 and 2012, which suggests that design changes should be evaluated to better accommodate the mix of roadway users along this downtown Bicycle Boulevard. The National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) recommends vehicle volumes lower than 1,500 per day to provide a comfortable bicycling environment for children, families, and others who feel unsafe riding in traffic. A number of City plans and policies have highlighted the stretch of Milvia Street in Downtown Berkeley as a high priority area for bicycle facility improvements. The Strategic Plan (2018), Bicycle Plan (2017), and Strategic Transportation Plan (2016) recommend replacing the existing segments of Class III bicycle shared-roadway markings and Class II bicycle lanes on Milvia between Hearst Avenue and Blake Street with a Class IV protected bikeway (also known as a cycle track). Similarly, the Streets and Open Space Improvement Plan (2012) and Downtown Area Plan (2012) recommend establishing a continuous bicycle lane and traffic calming on Milvia through downtown.","['Measure B & BB', 'Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities (AHSC)']",['Kenneth Jung'],"[['Kenneth Jung', 'Supervising Civil Engineer', 'kjung@cityofberkeley.info']]",[]

Construction began in March 2020 and is anticipated to be complete in Fall 2021. Phase I, completed in 2012, created a 0.1-mile, two-block section of Class 1 pathway from Murray Street to the Emeryville Greenway. Bicycle and pedestrian access from the Phase I pathway to the Ninth Street Bicycle Boulevard, is currently provided by a temporary Class 3 bicycle route on another section of Ninth Street that is separate from the main Ninth Street Bicycle Boulevard. A Class 3 bike route is a street designated for bicycle travel and shared with motor vehicles. This temporary route was constructed along Ninth Street between Anthony Street and Murray Street and on private property belonging to Berkeley Bowl West through a temporary easement, which was part of the provisions in their development agreement with the City. This Class 3 facility does not provide adequate bicycle and pedestrian access because it requires a longer, non-linear route and requires bicyclists to share a relatively narrow and congested road with motor vehicles. Phase II completes the pathway connection between West Berkeley and Emeryville by providing a safer, more direct, and continuous off-street route and intersection crossing, as opposed to the current temporary route. Phase II will construct the last two sections of new shared-use pathway on City-owned property; one section from the end of Ninth Street just south of the intersection with Heinz Avenue to Ashby Avenue, and the other section between Ashby Avenue and Murray Street.

Sacramento Complete Streets Project,Completed,Transportation,"The purpose of the Sacramento Complete Streets Improvements Project is to improve pedestrian and bicyclist safety at the following intersections of Sacramento Street: Virginia Street, Delaware Street, University Avenue, and Addison Street. Construction of the Project began in July 2020 and is anticipated to be completed in December 2021.","This Project addresses two City Council referrals for intersection safety improvements that are high-priority projects in the Pedestrian Master Plan – Sacramento Street at Addison Street (High Priority Project #4) and Sacramento Street at Virginia Street (High Priority Project #24). The improvements at Virginia Street and Delaware Street also address Tier 1 priority projects from the Bicycle Plan. In general, the work of this Project includes construction of new sidewalk extensions with directional curb ramps that meet the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); new pavement markings, including crosswalk, vehicular lane, and bike lane markings; a new traffic signal at the Virginia Street intersection; and dedicated left turn traffic signal phases at the University Avenue intersection to eliminate conflicts between pedestrians and left turning vehicles. For bicyclists that are comfortable sharing the roadway with a low volume of motor vehicles, the proposed new traffic signal at the Virginia Street intersection will improve safety for bicyclists along the Virginia Street bicycle boulevard and will encourage more bicycle riders to use this route. There will also be safety-related improvements for bicyclists that prefer to ride on a separated pathway, away from motor vehicles. City staff have been working closely with Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) on the latter’s proposed bicycle and motor vehicle ingress and egress modifications at the North Berkeley BART station. BART’s project will provide a needed link between two segments of the Ohlone Greenway pathway that are separated by this BART station, via dedicated bike lanes that will route bicyclists through the BART station grounds. BART’s construction project is expected to begin several months after the start of construction on the Sacramento Complete Streets Improvements Project. City staff hosted community meetings on January 28 and April 16, 2019 to solicit public input on the Project. The Project design was subsequently refined, and on May 15, 2019, staff presented the Project to a subcommittee of the Transportation Commission for comment. The Project design was refined based on comments received, and on June 20, 2019, staff presented the Project to the Transportation Commission.

The City will perform any required soil remediation and construct: Two new community gardens An outdoor classroom and orchard A playground for children ages 2-5-year-old with a tot cycle track Dog park Gathering spaces Pathways, landscaping, and lighting throughout the park The project is currently in the design phase. To be included in future correspondence and notifications of project meetings or status, please contact the project team with subject “Please add me to Santa Fe ROW New Park Development email list” and provide your preferred contact information. The Santa Fe Right-of-Way Park will be developed with grant funding from theCalifornia Statewide Park Development and Community Revitalization Program (SPP), funded by Proposition 68. Part of the State’s “Outdoors for All” initiative to enable all Californians to access parks and open space, the competitive CA SPP grant expands access to parks in underserved communities with new or enhanced parks. The City will remediate any soil contamination left by the site’s historic railroad use and ensure the site is safe for its future use as a new park. Initial soil sampling results show elevated levels of arsenic and lead in these four parcels. The City has posted all four blocks to warn residents to keep off. Read the results or go to the ""Documents"" section of this page. Updates to environmental work will be posted as they become available. In 1904, the Santa Fe Railroad established the “Oak­land Local,” which ran from Point Richmond to Oakland, and ran diagonally through Berkeley. The Oakland Local served passengers and freight until the 1950s, when the automobile doomed rail passen­ger service. While passenger service officially ended in the late 1950s, freight trains continued to run on the line while the City of Berkeley began to look at alternative ways to purchase and/or use the corridor. Since 1977, Berkeley worked to acquire and develop portions of the Santa Fe Railroad ROW into public amenities, including Cedar-Rose Park, Strawberry Creek park, and the West Street Pathway and Bike Boulevard. In 2020, the City identified CA SPP (Prop. 68) as a potential funding source to develop the vacant parcels in southwest Berkeley, and organized several community meetings to gather input and develop a conceptual plan for the grant application. The successful, community-driven conceptual plan was awarded state grant funds to bring “Outdoors for All” and expand access to parks in our Berkeley community. The conceptual plan submitted with the grant application and approved for funding is attached at the bottom of this webpage. Learn more about the CA SPP (Prop. 68) grant.

Tuolumne Camp Construction,Completed,Facility,"Berkeley Tuolumne Camp, 31858 Hardin Flat Road, Groveland, CA 95321","Berkeley Tuolumne Camp, in operation since 1922, has been a highly regarded summer tradition for generations of campers. More than 4,000 individuals annually enjoyed fun-filled activities and heartfelt traditions at Tuolumne Camp. On August 25, 2013, Berkeley Tuolumne Camp was largely destroyed by the Rim Fire, one of the largest and most damaging wildfires in California’s history. This was a devastating setback for the City of Berkeley and generations of staff and campers. Of the 138 total structures at the Camp, only 18 tent cabins and the restroom near Sun City survived the fire. The Berkeley Tuolumne Camp Project will replace the Camp facilities that were destroyed by the Rim Fire in 2013. In order to comply with current state, local and federal code, Camp facilities have been relocated and reconfigured, and additional off-street parking will be constructed. The work includes construction of buildings, bridges, parking, pathways and utilities. Construction began in May 2020, and is expected to take about 2 years to complete, depending on weather or unforeseen conditions. No interruptions to local residential sewer, water, gas, electric or phone service are anticipated. Hardin Flat Road in the immediate vicinity of Camp will be subject to intermittent closure or traffic control during construction. The entire Berkeley Tuolumne Camp permit area will be closed to pedestrian and recreational users throughout the construction.",['Federal Emergency Management Agency Grant'],['Liza McNulty'],"[['Liza McNulty', 'Capital Improvement Program Manager', 'Parks, Recreation & Waterfront']]",[]

Willard Clubhouse Project,Planning,Facility,"2720 Hillegass Avenue, Berkeley, CA 94705","This is a Measure T1 Phase 2 project. Due to a sharp increase in construction costs, 15% in the past year and another anticipated 10% this year, the cost estimate for the preferred plan for the new Willard Clubhouse has escalated the total project budget to over $8.0M. $7.0M of funding was identified in Phase 2 of T1, the City’s $100M Bond Measure passed in 2016. In response to the unanticipated increase, the project has been reduced in size and scope. The revised designreduces the building area to 3,285 SF. In lieu of three community rooms, comprising approximately 2,360 SF of activity space, the new community building will include one, divisible community room comprising approximately 1,700 SF and a new separate public restroom on the west side of the park. All other features will remain. The revised design provides an opportunity to create a multi-purpose outdoor plaza to the east of the building, similar in size to the existing outdoor plaza. The project is currently in the design phase and an application for a zoning permit has been submitted for a variance regarding a setback reduction and approval for a new accessory structure (the new outdoor public restroom). The status of the Zoning Project Application can be found at Parcel Conditions and Permit History A revised yellow project sign denoting development plans will be posted at the project site. Construction is anticipated to commence in summer 2023. The community engagement process included facilitated discussions with residents, stakeholders, user groups, and families participating in programs offered at Willard Clubhouse, and City of Berkeley staff. From October of 2019 to October of 2021, a series of 5 in-person and virtual community meetings with staff were held to gather input and hear about the needs and concerns of the community. Community and stakeholder meetings, workshops, and surveys took place between September 2019 and October 2021. Please see Past Events and Documents below for more information on the previously held community meetings. Built in 1971, the Willard Clubhouse is located at the southeast corner of Willard Park at 2720 Hillegass Avenue, between Derby Street and Stuart Street. The small 565 SF one-story, one-room clubhouse has long been a staple of Berkeley’s after-school and summer day camp programs, with each program serving a maximum of 45 elementary school aged children. Enrollment for both the after-school and summer day camp programs quickly reach the maximum capacity every year with a typical waitlist of approximately 25 children. Occupancy of the existing clubhouse is limited, therefore in order to accommodate 45 children, staff makes use of the adjacent covered patio, as well as the outside open lawn area to run activities and programs. Additionally, the large open lawn area makes the clubhouse and park a suitable location for the City’s recreation staff to host events such as the Annual Spring Egg Hunt Extravaganza. Willard Park is a valuable resource for the neighborhood, and the community has expressed that Willard Clubhouse is long overdue for an update to meet the evolving needs of the entire community. In the spring of 2019, the City of Berkeley selected ELS Architecture and Urban Design, a local firm, to provide professional architectural design services for the Willard Clubhouse and Restroom Replacement Project. Together with the City, the project team set out to design a new Willard Clubhouse that would meet the City’s program needs and also be sustainable, modern, accessible, and multi-generational. In October 2021, the final conceptual design for the new Willard Clubhouse and Restrooms was presented to the community. The design was for a 4,195 SF all electric, multi-purpose recreation building and featured a lobby, all gender restrooms, an office, kitchen, a 790 SF community room, and a larger 1,570 SF community room with a divisible wall to split the space into two smaller rooms. The site plan on page 15 of the October 28th, 2021 community meeting presentation shows the new building with a 20’ minimum required rear setback. Over the course of the community engagement period, members of the community expressed concern with expanding the clubhouse and its impact to open space. In response to the feedback from the community regarding preservation of lawn space, the project team has requested a variance to reduce the minimum 20’ rear setback to 16’ which would reduce the impacted lawn space. From October 2021 to May 2022, the project team developed a schematic design package for the new Willard Clubhouse and Restrooms, and prepared a Zoning Project Application that included the request for a 16’ rear setback variance. The application package was submitted to the City of Berkeley Land Use and Planning Division in June 2022.",['Measure T1'],"['Wendy Wellbrock', 'Evelyn Chan']","[['Wendy Wellbrock', 'Associate Civil Engineer', 'Parks, Recreation & Waterfront'], ['Evelyn Chan', 'Supervising Civil Engineer', 'Parks, Recreation & Waterfront']]",[]

Woolsey Street/Eton Avenue Intersection Project,Completed,Transportation,Woolsey Street/Eton Avenue intersection,"The existing makeshift traffic circle at the Woolsey Street/Eton Avenue intersection is not functioning efficiently as a traffic calming device. The objective of a traffic calming device is to encourage motorists to reduce their speed as they maneuver around the circle. The circle is also not configured to optimize vehicle turning movements. The Project is intended to improve safety for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists by reducing vehicular speeds, improving vehicle turning movements, and creating accessible pedestrian pathways by constructing new curb ramps and marked crosswalks. The Project originated as a result of a request by members of the neighborhood several years ago to enhance and improve the existing makeshift traffic circle. Initial funding was secured to perform an engineering study in 2014 under the City’s annual Traffic Calming budget. Prior scheduled projects to perform underground utility and paving work, as well as reprioritization of other competing projects resulted in a pause in work on this project. In 2019, City staff performed the engineering study, but due to a Public Works staffing shortage and the public health pandemic in 2020, funding for this project was reprioritized for other uses and the Project was again paused. The 2019 engineering study generated two conceptual design options based on traffic engineering design analysis and principles. Staff presented these options in an online community meeting on October 7, 2021. Based on community input, City staff will finalize the design and prepare “shovel-ready” construction bid documents. Woolsey Street and Eton Avenue are two-way, asphalt-paved residential streets with relatively low traffic volumes. According to the City’s General Plan, the nearest Major Street is College Avenue, located about 400 feet west of the intersection (intersecting Woolsey), and the nearest Collector Street is Claremont Avenue, located about 700 feet to the southeast (intersecting Eton). A makeshift traffic circle exists at the intersection of Woolsey and Eton. It consists of three spaced concrete planters (shown in green below) enclosed by a white circular pavement marking. The planters contain community-maintained vegetation. The three roadway legs of the intersection – two on Woolsey and one on Eton – each have yield markings. There are no marked crosswalks at the intersection, although two curb ramps exist, one on each side of Eton.
